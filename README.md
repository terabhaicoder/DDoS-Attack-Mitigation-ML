# **Leveraging Machine Learning for Robust DDoS Attack Mitigation**

## **Overview**
This project explores the use of machine learning models to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks. It includes implementations of Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

## **Dataset**
- **Source**: [Kaggle - DDoS Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devendra416/ddos-datasets)
- The dataset includes traffic data used to train and test the models for DDoS attack detection.

## **Implemented Models**
1. **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble method using multiple decision trees.
2. **XGBoost**: An optimized gradient boosting framework.
3. **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model for binary classification.
4. **Decision Tree**: A tree-structured classifier.
5. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model using Bayes' theorem.
6. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: A deep learning approach for complex pattern recognition.
